This is an attempt to teach myself Kotlin by going through the book "Real World Software Development" by Richard Warburton and Raoul-Gabriel Urma, and translating the 
Java code to Kotlin code by myself.

Since I just started learning Kotlin, I cannot guarantee the correctness of the output, and if they follow Kotlin 
guidelines.

The book, so far, uses JUnit for testing but I opted to try out [Kotest](https://kotest.io).
